# Chapter 4: Electronic Coupling in Covalently Bound Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Materials - Acenes on Silicon for Photoelectrochemical Devices

## 📘 Overview


## 🗂 Contents
- `..._PARCHG-HOMO` the partial charge integrated around the energy of the highest band of carbon p-orbitals on the molecule in the valence band
- `..._PARCHG-LUMO` the partial charge intergrated around the energy of the lowest band of carbon p-orbitals on the molecule in the conduction band
- `..._POSCAR` the input structure used
- `INCAR` used to calculate the density of states (DOS) from the converged structure
- `..._DOSCAR` DOS used to identify range for partial charge integration
